# Planner (a beginner app)


## Description

    Very much a WIP (including this README). 
    
    A Simple app to add shopping items to predefined lists (option to create new ones planned for future versions). 
    
    Beginning of a larger project. A draft if you will. Proof of concept albeit very bare bones. Current iteration is heavily based and inspired by CodeInstitutes codestar blog app.

## Getting Started

    Currently you can visit [Heroku](https://planer-draft-adf156db2691.herokuapp.com/) to test out the app. For now all you need is a browser (tested with Chrome).

    To use all functionalities you will need to create an account, but email is not being verified at the moment, so you can test with i.e test@test.com

## User Stories

    WIP

## Built With

* [Heroku.com](https://heroku.com)
* [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
* [JavaScript.com](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [DjangoProject.com](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [GetBootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [FontAwesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Testing

    So far testing was made during development, as needed. Further testing (linting, verifying etc.) will be provided in the near future.

## Planned Features

* Add more functionality
  * Option to add new lists and edit/delete existing ones, by non-superusers (aka. admins)
  * More robust and detailed items information - further model development (i.e. user estimated weekly/monthly/quarterly usage, expiration dates, calories -for food items - etc.)
  * Add lookup & sorting options for users
  * Add new model of "category" to categorize items into groups

* Overhaul of the UI and UX
  * Move edit forms into separate modals or animated side-bottom-topbars
  * Filtering options
  * Tailor app more towards phone users (buttons to open mentioned above modals)

* Add new apps:
  * Calorie calculator for food items 
  * Recipe app which ties into Shopping List app in various interactions
  * Meal planner

* Develop inter app functionalites:

    1. Verifying current supplie levels as indicated by "current_quantity" from Item model
    2. Suggesting a Shopping list additions based on selected Recipe
    3. Counting calories of recipe ingredients.
    4. Suggesting meals for the meal planner, based on supply & calorie intakes

## Known Bugs

    More testing needed (WIP)
